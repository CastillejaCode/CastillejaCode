Howdy, I’m @CastillejaCode, otherwise known as Julian. Decided to move away from pursuing medicine and ended up here as my new career path, fullstack web development that is. In my free time when I'm not on that grind typing away, I like to hike, bike, read, dance, go to the gym and learn about California native plants, California history, and anything else related to California really. 

My profile picture is me at Bumpass Hell at Lassen Volcanic National Park, cool place.
