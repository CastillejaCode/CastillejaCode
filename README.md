Howdy, I’m @CastillejaCode, otherwise known as Julian. Decided to move away from pursuing medicine and ended up here as my new career path, front-end web development that is. In my free time when I'm not on that grind typing away, I like to hike, bike, read, dance, go to the gym (OHP is my favorite exercise :) ), and learn about California native plants, California history, and anything else related to California really. 

My profile picture is an Indian Paintrbrush I found while hiking, a small plant from genus Castilleja  -  wait, isn't that your username? Yes, it is, I just really like this native plant!

Recently I have been focusing on Typescript, using Tailwind CSS instead of SCSS, Vite instead of Webpack, and Vitest instead of Jest. I also just hopped on the React train, it's pretty neat!

Talk to me about anything at jkrzysiak13@gmail.com (coding and plants would be cool)
